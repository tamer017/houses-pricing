    from the graph 
    1- the number of bedrooms is directly proportional to the price of the house
    2- the number of bathrooms is directly proportional to the price of the house
    3- the number of floors is directly proportional to the price of the house
    4- the area of the lot  is directly proportional to the price of the house
    5- the area of the leaving  is directly proportional to the price of the house 
    6- the area of the basement  is directly proportional to the price of the house
    7- the area of the abovefloor  is directly proportional to the price of the house
    8- the yaer of build is also directly proportional to the price of the house how ever this effect is very small so we can ignore it
    9- the yaer of renovated is also inversely proportional to the price of the house how ever this effect is very small so we can ignore it
    10- the water view  is also directly proportional to the price of the house
    11- the number of views of the building is also directly proportional to the price of the house
    12- the conditioning is directly proportional to the price of the house how ever this effect is very small so we can ignore it
